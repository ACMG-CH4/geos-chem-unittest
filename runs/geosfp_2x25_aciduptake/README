This directory is the run directory for the GEOS-Chem unit tester,
for GEOS-FP met fields, 2x2.5 grid, and benchmark simulation with the acid
uptake on dust option turned on. This simulation uses the default benchmark
chemistry mechanism (tropchem + UCX + SOA ).

Chemistry files are linked to ../chem_inputs/benchmark and the HEMCO
configuration file is linked to HEMCO_Config.template stored in
../chem_inputs/specialty/HEMCO_Config.template.aciduptake.  This allows us to
keep a single set of these files in one location, for convenience.

A new input.geos file will be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
