This is the GEOS-Chem run directory for the 2x2.5 Rn-Pb-Be simulation.  This
directory can be used with GEOS-FP or MERRA-2 meteorology.

The HEMCO configuration file is linked to HEMCO_Config.template.RnPbBe stored
in ../chem_inputs/specialty.  This allows us to keep a single set of these
files in one location, for convenience.  A new HEMCO_Config.rc file will be
created from the HEMCO_Config.template file each time the unit tester is run.

A new input.geos file will also be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
