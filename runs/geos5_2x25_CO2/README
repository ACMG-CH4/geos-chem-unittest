This directory is the run directory for the GEOS-Chem unit tester,
for GEOS-5 met fields, 2x25 grid, and CO2 simulation.

A new input.geos file will be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
