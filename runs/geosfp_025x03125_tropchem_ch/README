This directory is the run directory for the GEOS-Chem unit tester,
for GEOS-FP met fields, 0.25x0.3125 nested CH grid, and the standard
NOx-Ox-HC-Aer-Br tropospheric chemistry mechanism.

Chemistry files are linked to ../chem_inputs/fullchem and the HEMCO
configuration file is linked to HEMCO_Config.template.ch stored in
../chem_inputs/fullchem/.  This allows us to keep a single set of these
files in one location, for convenience.

The HEMCO restart file is symbolically linked to the ../geos5_4x5_fullchem
directory, which has been spun up for one month at 4x5. HEMCO will handle
regridding the restart variables to model resolution.

A new input.geos file will be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.

The tracer restart file was provided by Yuxuan Wang and was regridded from
a 4x5 global restart file.
