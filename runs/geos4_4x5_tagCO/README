This is the GEOS-Chem run directory for the 4x5 tagged CO simulation with
GEOS-4 meteorology.

The HEMCO configuration file is linked to HEMCO_Config.template.tagCO stored
in ../chem_inputs/specialty.  This allows us to keep a single set of these
files in one location, for convenience.  A new HEMCO_Config.rc file will be
created from the HEMCO_Config.template file each time the unit tester is run.

A new input.geos file will also be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
