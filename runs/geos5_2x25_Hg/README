This directory is the run directory for the GEOS-Chem unit tester,
for GEOS-5 met fields, 2x2.5 grid, and the mercury simulation.

The tracer and ocean restart files are linked to the files in the
../merra_2x25_Hg directory. Jenny Fisher provided these restart files
for inclusion in v11-01c. These files were generated for 20090101 using
MERRA 4x5 met fields. MERRA uses the same vertical grid as the
GEOS-5 (aka GEOS-5.2.0) and GEOS-FP met field products, so the restart
files are interchangeable.

The HEMCO configuration file is linked to HEMCO_Config.template.Hg stored
in ../chem_inputs/specialty.  This allows us to keep a single set of these
files in one location, for convenience.

A new input.geos file will be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
