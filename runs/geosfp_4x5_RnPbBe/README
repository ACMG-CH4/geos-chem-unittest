This directory is the run directory for the GEOS-Chem unit tester,
for GEOS-FP met fields, 4x5 grid, and the Rn-Pb-Be simulation.

The HEMCO configuration file is linked to HEMCO_Config.template.RnPbBe stored
in ../chem_inputs/specialty.  This allows us to keep a single set of these
files in one location, for convenience.

A new input.geos file will be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
