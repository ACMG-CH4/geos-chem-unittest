This directory is the run directory for the GEOS-Chem unit tester,
for GEOS-5 met fields, 4x5 grid, and standard Rn-Pb-Be simulation.

The tracer restart files are linked to the files in the ../geos5_4x5_RnPbBe 
GEOS-FP uses the same vertical grid as the GEOS-5 (aka GEOS-5.2.0) and MERRA 
met field products, so the restart files are interchangeable.

A new input.geos file will be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
