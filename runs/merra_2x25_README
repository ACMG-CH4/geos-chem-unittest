You can create a MERRA run directory from a GEOS-5 or GEOS-FP run directory,
since all three met fields have the same horizontal and vertical resolution.

Gabriele Curci found found that the following procedure can be used to create
a MERRA run directory from a GEOS-FP run directory. This example uses the
geosfp_4x5_UCX run directory.

  1. Create a run directory for GEOS-FP using gcCopyRunDirs
  2. Type "cp -R geosfp_4x5_UCX merra_4x5_UCX"
  3. Type "cd merra_4x5_UCX"
  4. Type "rename geosfp merra *"
  5. Open input.geos in a text editor and change all the occurrences of
     "geosfp" to "merra"
  6. Type "make superclean"
  7. Type "make distclean" in the Code dir
  8. Compile and run
