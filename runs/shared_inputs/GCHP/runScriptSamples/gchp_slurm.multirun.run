# This run script is for use within gchp_slurm.multirun.sh which submits multiple
# consecutive GCHP jobs to break up longer runs into smaller jobs of shorter duration.
#
# NOTES:
#  1. This run script is used within gchp_slurm.multirun.sh and should not be used
#     on its own. Use gchp_slurm.run instead if not doing multi-segmented runs.
#  2. All stdout is sent to gchp.log without deleting the existing file.
#  3. runConfig.sh is NOT sourced within this run script. Sourcing that file is done in 
#     gchp_slurm.multirun.sh prior to submitting the very first job.
#  4. cap_restart is not deleted but the content is sent to cap_restart.log.

# See SLURM documentation for descriptions of the above settings as well
# as many other settings you may use.
