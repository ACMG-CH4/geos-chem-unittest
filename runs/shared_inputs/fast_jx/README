NOTE: The FAST-JX input files stored in this runs/shared_inputs/fast_jx
folder are common to all GEOS-Chem full-chemistry simulations.  

These files are symbolically linked to the following folders:

  ../aciduptake
  ../marinePOA
  ../complexSOA
  ../standard
  ../tropchem

If you have to edit these FAST-JX input files, edit them in this folder,
and the changes will propagate to the other folders via the symlinks.
