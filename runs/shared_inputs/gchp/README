NOTE: The GCHP configuration files stored in this runs/shared_inputs/gchp
folder are common to all GEOS-Chem full-chemistry simulations.  

These files are symbolically linked to the following folders:

  ../benchmark
  ../RnPbBe
  ../standard

If you have to edit these GCHP configuration files, edit them in this folder,
and the changes will propagate to the other folders via the symlinks.
