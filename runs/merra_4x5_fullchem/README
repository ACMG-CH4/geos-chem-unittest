This directory is the run directory for the GEOS-Chem unit tester,
for MERRA met fields, 4x5 grid, and standard "fullchem" mechanism.

Chemistry files are linked to ../chem_inputs/fullchem.  This allows us to
keep a single set of these files in one location, for convenience.

Because MERRA uses the same vertical grid as GEOS-5, we have created a 
symbolic link to the restart file in the ../geos5_4x_5_fullchem directory.

A new input.geos file will be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
