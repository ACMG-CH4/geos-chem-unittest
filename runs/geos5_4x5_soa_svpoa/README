This directory is the run directory for the GEOS-Chem unit tester,
for GEOS-5 met fields, 4x5 grid, and the SOA-SVPOA chemistry mechanism.

Chemistry files are linked to ../chem_inputs/soa_svpoa.  This allows us to
keep a single set of these files in one location, for convenience.

A new input.geos file will be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
