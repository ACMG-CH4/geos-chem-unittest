This directory is the run directory for the GEOS-Chem unit tester,
for GEOS-5 met fields, 2x2.5 grid, and mass conservation test.

NOTE: This is a CO2 simulation with the initial conditions being 370 ppm
everywhere.  From this simulation, we can print out the values of total
CO2 every few hours.  This will let us determine if GEOS-Chem is
conserving mass.

We recommend copying this directory via the gcCopyRunDirs script and to run 
this test from the copied run directory.
