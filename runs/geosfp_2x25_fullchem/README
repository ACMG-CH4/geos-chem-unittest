This directory is the run directory for the GEOS-Chem unit tester,
for GEOS-FP met fields, 2x2.5 grid, and standard "fullchem" mechanism.

Chemistry files are linked to ../chem_inputs/fullchem and the HEMCO
configuration file is linked to HEMCO_Config.template stored in
../chem_inputs/fullchem.  This allows us to keep a single set of these
files in one location, for convenience.

Because GEOS-FP uses the same vertical grid as GEOS-5, we have created a 
symbolic link to the restart files in the ../geos5_2x25_fullchem directory.
The HEMCO restart file has been spun up for one month at 4x5. HEMCO will
handle regridding the restart variables to model resolution.

A new input.geos file will be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
